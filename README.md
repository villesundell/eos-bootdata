List of EOS peers for mainnet in config.ini format, and other relevant information to connect to the future mainnet

This repository contains all kind of information regarding the future mainnet, including:
* genesis.json Genesis information
* config-example-node.ini A template configuration file you can use as a base for your own node. **Not hardened**
* **config.ini list of peers you can directly copy & paste to your config.ini**

To include your node to the peer list, you can:
* Make a PR
* Contact Ville (@SolariusFI) on Telegram
* Mail Ville at eosbootdata@solarius.fi

Kudos to Charles Ju for providing me the initial configuration file to work on :)
